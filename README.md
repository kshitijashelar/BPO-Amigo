Abstract

Call centers are service centers that act as a bridge between enterprise and customers.
Importance is being given to customer satisfaction and also to performance of call center agents. 
However, few researches are being done by taking both â€“ the customers and the call center agents as the end users. 
A system performing aspect-based sentiment analysis is being designed and implemented. 
The proposed system incorporates audio to text conversion, sentiment analysis and a separate customer-login module.
It is able to represent sentiments of customers regarding any particular aspect using joint bar graphs. 


- The proposed system can be best implemented in any call center or customer service center
- The web app can be made available to customers online, so that they can make use of the suggestion module in order to get product suggestions
